.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad b
\fBAldo\fP is developed from scratch in ISO C++ using GNU C++ Standard Library and libao (www.xiph.org/ao).
.br
It is a morse code learning tool which provides four type of training methods:
.br
.PP
.TP
.B Blocks
 Identify blocks of random characters played in morse code.
.TP
.B Koch
 Two morse characters will be played at full speed (20wpm)
 until you'll be able to identify at least 90 percent of them. 
 After that, one more character will be added, and so on.
.TP

.SH NOTES
The "Device" option under the keyer depends on the particular driver.
The "default" setting picks the default sound device.  This option may
be used to pick a different soundcard than the default one.

For alsa, it is "hw:<card>,<device>", where the card and device number
are the particular hardware devices.  The default is generally
"hw:0.0".  Generally 0 is the first card, 1 is the second, etc.  Some
sound cards may have multiple output devices, the device picks the
particular one.

For oss, sun, and aixs, it is the device name, like /dev/dsp.

For esd, it is the host name, like "whizbang.com:555".

It is not used on any other drivers.
