By selecting 4 you can set up the Callsign exercise.
Specify your preferred callsign format, using "wildcards":.

@ = random letter
# = random number
? = optional letter
$ = optional number

A fixed letter or a fixed number, (such as "i" or "8" in the examples
below), is used literally. 

For example:

iz8@@@ is a format for callsigns like iz8bqi iz8eqd iz8tpz etc..
iz#m@@ gives iz0muv iz9mer iz8mrd etc..
iz#@@@ gives iz2qwe iz1ert etc..
i?8@@@ gives i8mro iz8eqd it8aa ih8epz etc..
i?#@@@ gives imro izqvo iz8mrt etc..
kc#@@@ gives kc0mnn kc1hjy kc9yup

NOTE: Callsign formats must be lower case: e.g. iz#m@@, not IZ#M@@

Select 1 to train by the Blocks Method
Select 2 to train by the Koch Method
Select 3 for Aldo to read a text file from disk
Select 4 to train by using random callsigns

Now listen to your speakers.
Identify the morse characters and write them on a sheet of paper.
If you are unsure, use an underscore ( _ ) to hold the place of missed letters.

When the exercise has finished you should enter the characters at the keyboard.
Entering the characters at the keyboard, please replace underscore ( _ ) with @.
ALDO will then compare your results with the correct version.

If you have suggestions for additional features, please send me an email
